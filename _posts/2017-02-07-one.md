Version 1.0 has been released! This version contains the basic funtionality for an RDAP Server defined in RFCs 7480,7481,7482 and 7483.

A demo server will be released later next week. We are also working on a migration tool to help you to migrate your data from your WHOIS server to your RDAP server.
