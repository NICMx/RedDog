RedDog 1.1 has been released.

The code has been reviewed and several internals were refactored. Most notably, the Data Access API is now easier to implement and the SQL provider has been pushed back to development due to deployment issues.

What used to be called "custom mode" is, in the meantime, the only recommended usage of RedDog. The Basic form will be revised and likely come back in the next major release.
