title: RedDog Server 1.2.2 patch released
---

## 2017-12-14

RedDog Server 1.2.2 has been released with some bug fixes:
- Pull request "[Include the "scheme" in self links](https://github.com/NICMx/rdap-server/pull/77)" (thanks [@bsnow-shl](https://github.com/bsnow-shl)).
- Partial fix to [issue #76](https://github.com/NICMx/rdap-server/issues/76): "Should we keep regex searches code in rdap-server?". The regex searches support is disabled by default, but it can be enabled using a new configuration flag `allow_regex_searches` (not recommended since is out of date, hopefully this will be updated on a later release).
- Documentation and demo server updated as well.
